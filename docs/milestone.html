    <h2 align="middle">Progress Summary</h2>
      <p>  The goal of our project is to make a simulation of fire that is as realistic as possible,
        but also innovative and efficient.
        One of our main goals was to experiment with new ways of rendering fire that circumvent the approximate
        (numerical) integration of PDEs, expensive
         grid sampling techniques, and complicated
        ray tracing techniques to render the fire realistically.
        One way we hoped to do this was to try to exploit
        the dynamics exhibited by certain simplified probabilistic lattice models
        in their "scaling limits", or in other words as the granularity of the lattice approaches
        a continuum. In our explorations thus far, we have created a 2-dimensional rendering of fire
        using a probabilistic model for the propogation of the flame.</p>


      <h2 align="middle">The Algorithm</h2>
        <p> The model we have is a markov chain on a finite N x N lattice,
        inspired by lattice models in statistical mechanics, such as the ising model and
        abelian sandpile model. In the algorithm below, i is a vertical coordinate
        (going upwards)
        and j is a horizontal coordinate (ie (j, i) are is a discrete sample of (x, y)-space).</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Iniitialize an N by N texture 'pixel' with bottom sites (source) at max brightness.
              Array elements can either be 'on' or 'off', which we denote by 1, or 0.
                Initialize parameters b, s, r > 0 such that  0 < s < 1, 0 < s r < 1, and 0 < b s r < 1
                (these will be used as coin flip probabilities). For simplicity, set
                p = s r; set q = b s r.
            </li>

            <li>(Imagine the pixel squares as a chess board). First iterate over each
              white square (i, j) in the texture.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Case 1 - (i, j) is 'off': then
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       If pixel(i-1, j) is 'on', set (i, j) to 'on' with probability q
                    </li>
                      <li>
                         Iterate through other neighbors (i', j'). If
                         (i', j') is on, set (i, j) to 'on' with probability p.
                      </li>

                    </ul>


                  </li>

                <li>
                  Case 2 - (i, j) is 'on': then iterate through each neighbor (i', j'),
                  and if (i', j') is off, set (i, j) to off with probability s.
                </li>
              </ul>

            Reapeat this for the black squares</li>

            <li>Repeat step 2.</li>

          </ol>

           </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Updated Plan</h2>
      <p> Week 1: Finish assignment 4, and decide whether to use this project as skeleton code for our fire simulation.
          Also in week 1, we plan to read relevant references on the subject and study existing implementations.
      </p>
      <p> Week 2: We hope to try to have a prototype of a working simulation.
      </p>
      <p> Week 3: Refine the simulation, experiment with parameters to tune, possibly experiment with an alternative
        method of implementation.
      </p>
      <p> Week 4: We leave our "hopes" for this week. In particular, during this week we hope to write
        an applet that has a simple user interface with which we could display our simulation. We also hope to
        be able to simulate fire in 3D environment, and to be able to capture the visual effect of "mirage"
        or "heat haze", which occurs because the temperature gradient in the air is high,
        causing light to bend in unusual ways.
