    <h2 align="middle">Progress Summary</h2>
      <p>  The goal of our project is to make a simulation of fire that is as realistic as possible,
        but also innovative and efficient.
        One of our main goals was to experiment with new ways of rendering fire that circumvent the approximate
        (numerical) integration of PDEs, expensive
         grid sampling techniques, and complicated
        ray tracing techniques to render the fire realistically.
        One way we hoped to do this was to try to exploit
        the dynamics exhibited by certain simplified probabilistic lattice models
        in their "scaling limits", or in other words as the granularity of the lattice approaches
        a continuum. In our explorations thus far, we have created a 2-dimensional rendering of fire
        using a probabilistic model for the propogation of the flame.</p>


      <h2 align="middle">The Algorithm</h2>
        <p> The model we have is a markov chain on a finite N x N lattice,
        inspired by lattice models in statistical mechanics, such as the ising model and
        abelian sandpile model. In the algorithm below, i is a vertical coordinate
        (going upwards)
        and j is a horizontal coordinate (ie (j, i) are is a discrete sample of (x, y)-space).</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Iniitialize an N by N texture 'pixel' with bottom sites (source) at max brightness.
              Array elements can either be 'on' or 'off', which we denote by 1, or 0.
                Initialize parameters b, s, r > 0 such that  0 < s < 1, 0 < s r < 1, and 0 < b s r < 1
                (these will be used as coin flip probabilities). For simplicity, set
                p = s r; set q = b s r.
            </li>

            <li>(Imagine the pixel squares as a chess board). First iterate over each
              white square (i, j) in the texture.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Case 1 - (i, j) is 'off': then
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       If pixel(i-1, j) is 'on', set (i, j) to 'on' with probability q
                    </li>
                      <li>
                         Iterate through other neighbors (i', j'). If
                         (i', j') is on, set (i, j) to 'on' with probability p.
                      </li>

                    </ul>


                  </li>

                <li>
                  Case 2 - (i, j) is 'on': then iterate through each neighbor (i', j'),
                  and if (i', j') is off, set (i, j) to off with probability s.
                </li>
              </ul>

            Reapeat this for the black squares</li>

            <li>Repeat step 2.</li>

          </ol>

    <h2 align="middle">Updated Plan</h2>
      <p>In the next two weeks we plan on taking two different approaches. Our first approach is taking what we have and making it better. Our ideas currently are to make the fire simulation three dimensional and change the color of the fire. Other aspirations include smoke or other fire effects. Since the model we have currently is based more on a randomness and a probabilistic algorithm, we want to see if we can implement a different method of fire rendering based on physical equations. This second approach would not be a real time simulation, but rather one in which we attempt to render fire using ray tracing and see how realistic we can get it. </p>
      <p>Hopefully we can implement both approaches so that we can compare the pros and cons of them in terms of fire simulation or rendering. </p>
